Madonna with the Long Neck is a notable example of mannerist painting. Mannerism is characterized by emphasis on instability and tension, which is apparent in the unbalanced composition of the painting. Another mannerist characteristic is elongated and unnatural proportions of the characters: Virgin Mary has a very long neck, baby Jesus is unusually large, and St. Jerome barely reaches Mary's knee.
