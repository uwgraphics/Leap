0. Overview



The recommended pipeline can be visualized as follows:

[DAZ] => (FBX,COLLADA) => [3ds Max] => (FBX) => [Asset Tools] => (FBX) => [Unity]
              ||                                     /\
              ||=====================================||

LEAP is built on Unity engine, and it relies on Unity's asset infrastucture to
prepare and import models. The primary model import format is FBX, though 
COLLADA is supported as well. Basic features like skinning, multitexturing and 
shader materials are implicitly supported. Additionally, LEAP implements 
support for facial animation using morph targets (blend shapes).

Your models can come from any source, but one of the most convenient ways of
creating and animating them is by using the figure posing and rendering studio
DAZ. Since DAZ has excellent support for FBX and COLLADA export, a model can
be easily exported directly to Unity, or to your favorite modeling application
like 3ds Max or Maya for additional editing.

If your model contains morph target animation, you need to first import it
into 3ds Max for additional tweaking. We provide a set of Max scripts which 
extract morph target animations into a representation that can be imported 
into Unity and used by LEAP. Moreover, before the FBX models are imported into
Unity, you must invoke a special standalone utility to automatically post-
process the morph targets, otherwise Unity won't import them correctly.



1. Exporting character models - 3ds Max

In order to get your model into Unity, you will need to export it as an FBX
file. For this you will need Autodesk FBX plugins for 3ds Max; it is 
recommended that you get the latest version, though anything from 2011 on
should work fine.

To export your model, you need to go File -> Export, specify FBX as your target 
format, and then specify the appropriate FBX plugin settings. For general guide-
lines on configuring the FBX plugin, consult the plugin documentation. Here we
will give guidelines on features of particular relevance to Unity and LEAP.

1.1 Skeleton

FBX plugin: Can export Max Dummy nodes and Bones, but only with Skin modifier 
(Physique is not supported). Be sure to enable Skin export in plugin export
settings. Moreover, since LEAP uses the metric system, make sure that under 
Units the target unit is set to meters.

Gaze helpers: If you want to use LEAP's Gaze Controller, you must create 
helper bones for every bone in the gaze chain (normally head and eyes). This
can be done in Unity itself, but the recommended approach is to do it in 
3ds Max. The procedure is as follows:

   1. Select the bone for which you want to create a helper.

   2. Clone the bone (Ctrl+V), and give it an appropriate name.

   3. Max will automatically link the helper bone to the *parent* of the 
   original bone, which is incorrect - unlink the bone e.g. using the Schematic
   View. 

   4. Next, translate the helper bone in the direction of the gaze (e.g. if the
   bone is an eye helper, translate it through the pupils of the eye).
   Translation magnitude is unimportant, as long as it is greater than 0.

   5. Finally, link the cloned bone to the original bone (e.g. left eye gaze 
  helper would be linked to the left eye).

1.2 Morph targets

FBX plugin: Exports morph targets defined using Morpher modifier without
problems. Be sure to enable Morph export in the plugin settings.

Original meshes: If your scene still contains the original meshes that are
linked to the Morpher modifier, you should delete them before export.

1.3 Materials

Alpha and gloss maps: If your character was exported from DAZ, then 
transparency and gloss data will be stored in separate textures, but Unity
expects them to be encoded in the alpha channel of the diffuse texture. You
can use Photoshop or similar tool to add an alpha channel to the diffuse 
texture, and copy your transparency/gloss data there. When saving your final
image, be sure to save it in a format that supports the alpha channel, such as
TIFF. Moreover, after importing the model to Unity, you may need to manually
edit the material and change texture type from Diffuse to Specular or
Transparent.

1.4 Animations

Morph channels: Animation in LEAP is based on morph channels. A morph channel
is an animation parameter that animates some part of the character - e.g.
ModifierBlinkLeft closes the left eye, ExpressionFear deforms the face into a
fearful expression, VisemeAh deforms the lips into the shape of phoneme 'Ah'.
Since character model can differ in their bone structure and/or morph targets
they have, in order to work correctly for a specific character, morph channels
need to be manually mapped to that character's morph targets and bone trans-
formations. The only way to currently define morph channel mappings is using
an XML file format called LMC (see section 2.2 for details).

Morph target animation: If your model contains morph target animations, Unity 
will not be able to import them; it can only import bone animations. The trick
is to create dummy bones and copy morph target keyframes onto them; the dummy
bones and keyframe data on them will be correctly imported by Unity. We provide
a Max script UnityMorphAnimSetup.ms which can be invoked to automatically
extract animations for several well-known DAZ figures. With modifications, the
script can be used for other models as well.

For example, to extract morph target animations from a character based on
DAZ Genesis figure, simply do the following:

   1. If you scene already contains dummy bones for LEAP morph channels, delete
   them. You will recognize them in the Schematic View because their names
   start with the prefix MC (e.g. "MC&VisemeEh").

   2. On the 3ds Max main menu, go to MAXScript -> Run Script, and choose
   the Max script UnityMorphAnimSetup.ms.

   3. Press F11 to open the MAXScript Listener, and invoke the following
   script function:

	setupMorphAnimations mcDAZGenesisMappings

   where mcDAZGenesisMappings is a global array defined in
   UnityMorphAnimSetup.ms, which defines mappings between the character's
   morph targets and LEAP morph channels.

   4. Check the Schematic View to make sure that the script has created the
   dummy bones in your scene.

Note: If you want to use the script with different characters that use a
different set of morph targets, you need to specify morph target -> morph
channel mappings as a first argument to setupMorphAnimations. Examples of such
mappings can be found in UnityMorphAnimSetup.ms.

1.5 Lip-sync

LEAP does not currently provide an on-line lip-sync solution, so any lip-sync
animations need to be generated offline. The recommended way of doing so is 
using the inexpensive FaceFX 3ds Max plugin.

Though limited compared to the full-fledged FaceFX Studio, FaceFX plugin can
generate lip animations given an audio file and accompanying text script. To
generate a lip-sync animation for one audio clip, do the following:

   1. Load the FaceFX plugin by going to the Utilities tab -> More... -> 
   FaceFX.

   2. Set the Analysis Actor for your character figure by clicking Change 
   Analysis Actor and choosing the appropriate .facefx Actor file. Characters 
   with different morph target sets or bone structures should have different 
   analysis actors. We provide analysis actors for a several DAZ figures, 
   including Genesis.

   3. Load the Actor file (.fx) for your character by clicking Load Actor and
   choosing the appropriate .facefx file. This is often going to be the same as
   your analysis actor - for example, that is the case with our DAZ figure 
   actors.

   4. Under Animations, click Generate and choose your audio file. If there is 
   a text file with the same name in the same directory containing the script 
   of the audio utterance, FaceFX will use it to improve lip-sync results.

   5. To import the generated keyframe data onto your model, select the model 
   mesh, position the Time Slider to where you want your animation to be, and 
   then (under FaceFX->Animations) click Import. 

The generated lip-sync animation data can then be exported just like any other 
animation. Note that, since lip-sync animations usually include morph target
animations, you will need to use the procedure described in 1.4 to extract
morph target animation data onto dummy bones.

FaceFX actors: When FaceFX performs audio analysis, it needs to know how to map
inferred phonemes to morph targets or bones of the target character. FaceFX
actors (stored as .facefx files) define mappings of phonemes to morph targets
and bones. Analysis actors are used to map FaceFX standardized phonemes to
viseme channels used by your system, while 'main' actors are normally used
to map viseme channels to morph targets and bones, and often more general
conversational animation (e.g. special channels for controlling eye blinks,
eyebrows and other parts of the face).

You can define a FaceFX analysis actor for your character using the free 
version of FaceFX Studio. Due to limitations of the free version, you will
probably want to keep your actor as simple as possible (just one-on-one 
mappings of FaceFX phonemes to viseme morph targets), and then use is as your
'main' actor. For more information on how to use FaceFX, consult the FaceFX
documentation and examples.



2. Importing character models



2.1 Morph target preprocessing

If your model contains morph targets, they need to be preprocessed by a special
Asset Tools command line utility FBXMorphPreprocess before Unity can import 
them. Simply call:

	FBXMorphPreprocess ludacris.fbx

2.2 Writing your LMC file

Next you must define morph channels for you character. Morph channels for a 
specific character (or a class of characters based on the same model figure) 
are defined using the LMC file format.

Unfortunately, there is currently no GUI application for defining morph channel
mappings, so LMC files must be written manually. Each LMC file must contain a
sequence of morph channel definitions. Each morph channel definition specifies
a list of 1) morph targets, 2) bone transformations (rotation/translation), 
and 3) other morph channels, that the current morph channel maps to. Magnitude
of a morph target, transformation, or morph subchannel can be controlled using
the refValue parameter (0-1 - though values <1 are typically used only for
complex morph channels that engage multiple morph targets)

A trimmed-down example of an LMC file can be seen below:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LMC xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">

          <refPosition>
            <x>0</x>
            <y>0</y>
            <z>0</z>
          </refPosition>
          <refRotation>
            <x>6.000001</x>
            <y>0</y>
            <z>0</z>
          </refRotation>
        </LMCBoneMapping>
      </bones>
    </LMCMorphChannel>
  </morphChannels>
</LMC>

One nice thing with DAZ characters is that the LMC file typically needs to be 
defined only once per figure. That means, if you have an array of characters 
using the same base figure (e.g. Genesis), you can reuse the LMC file for all
the characters. For example, we provide LMC files that should work for most
characters based on DAZ Genesis figure.

Once you have defined your LMC file, give it the same name as your FBX file
(e.g. ludacris.lmc) and place it in the same directory.

2.3 Importing into Unity

In LEAP's Assets\Agents directory, create a subdirectory for your character
(e.g. Assets\Agents\Ludacris), and copy the character's FBX and LMC files 
there. Next, open up Unity, and it will automatically try and import the
character with default importer settings. These settings usually won't be
correct for your specific character, so you will need to modify them and then
reimport the model.

Import settings: To modify the import settings, select the model in the 
Project view. Then in the Inspector, under FBXImporter, specify the following:

   - Scale Factor: 1
   
   - Mesh Compression: Off
   
   - Optimize Mesh should be unchecked.

   - Normals: This should be set to Import. However, if you notice any 
   problems with your model's shading, or if during animation you notice that
   some vertices aren't animated correctly, try setting this option to 
   Calculate. Then you should also set Smoothing Angle to maximum (180).

   - Animation Wrap Mode: Set it to Loop.

   - Animation List: Here you must specify the list of animations on your 
   character (otherwise all keyframe data will be lumped into a single
   'animation', usually called 'Take01'). For each animation, specify its name
   start and end frames, wrap mode (usually Loop).

Once you are done modifying the import settings, click Apply and wait for the
model to be reimported.

2.4 Instancing the model

Imported models can be instanced by simply dragging and dropping them into the
scene.

2.5 Setting up default components

When your model was imported, LEAP automatically added some basic functional
components onto it, such as Morph Controller and other scripts needed for 
animation. However, to give your character more advanced LEAP capabilities,
such as gaze, speech, and head gestures, you need to add and configure the
components (scripts) which implement said functionality. The easiest way to do
this is to select the character in the Hierarchy view and then click LEAP -> 
Agent Setup -> Set Up Default Agent on Unity main menu. This will add common
used components to the character, and apply default settings to them. Some 
manual configuration may still be needed for individual components, as we
describe below.

Body Idle Controller:

   - Idle Animation: Set it to whatever you want the idle animation to be (e.g.
   NeutralPose, or NeutralPoseSit).

   - Perlin Motion Enabled: Set to true if you want some random motion to be
   applied to the character to make it appear less rigid.

   - Perlin Motion Gen: Here you can configure the type of random motion that
   will be applied. To apply random motion to a bone or set of morph channels,
   expand the Transforms field with a new element and, for the new Transform,
   define settings such as transf. type, axes, magnitude, rate, bone and morph
   channel list.

Face Controller:

   - Perlin Motion Enabled: Same as Body Idle Controller.

   - Perlin Motion Gen: Same as Body Idle Controller.

Gaze Controller:

   - Stylized Gaze: Enable if you want cartoon dynamics (as opposed to bio-
   logical dynamics) to be applied to the character's eye motion.

   - Gaze Joints: Define the chain of bones that will be affected by the Gaze
   Controller. The chain should have the hierarchy of the following form:
   
   ...---> Body3 ---> Body2 ---> Body1 ---> LEye
                                        |
                                        |-> REye

   The bones should be defined in the sequence (LEye, REye, Body1, Body2,
   Body3, ...) For each bone, define type (left eye, right eye, or body),
   velocity (human eyes - 150; human head - 50), motor range (human eyes -
   45, 45, 55, 55; human head - 90, 90, 180, 180), bone, and helper bone.

2.6 Creating a prefab agent

Once you are happy with your character is set up, you can create a prefab from
it. This will allow you to easily use the character in different scenes, by
simply dragging and dropping the prefab into the scene.

First create an empty prefab in your character's Assets\Agents subdirectory,
by going to the Unity main menu and clicking Assets -> Create -> Prefab. Next,
drag and drop your character from the Hierarchy view and onto the prefab in the
Project view. This will link the prefab to your character.

If you have made changes to a character model (e.g. added new animations or
modified morph targets), any character instanced from its prefab may no longer
look or behave correctly. In that case, you should select the character
instance in the scene, click LEAP -> Agent Setup -> Refresh Agent, and the
selected instance will be updated accordingly. You may need to relink it to its
prefab afterwards.



3. Creating characters - DAZ



DAZ is a commercial character editing, posing and animation tool, commonly used
by enthusiasts who want to create 3D render art. More recently it has received
excellent support for exporting the character into game engine-friendly formats
such as FBX, which has increased its popularity among game designers and other
users who can benefit from high-quality 3D characters. We highly recommend it
as a cost-effective source of characters for use with LEAP, and we have gone to
great lengths to set up a content path from DAZ to Unity for this purpose.

3.1 Obtaining DAZ and purchasing characters

DAZ main program can be downloaded free of charge from DAZ website. Simply
download it and follow the installation instructions. Characters must be 
purchased through the online DAZ store. Again, once you have purchased a
character, simply download it and follow the installation instructions.

3.2 Creating your character

To create your own character, simply choose a starting character (e.g. one you
downloaded from DAZ store) and edit it using the provided parameters. For more
information consult DAZ documentation.

3.3 Exporting the character

Once you are happy with how your character looks, you can export it and then
either import it into Max for additional work, or directly import it into Unity
(you may need to run it through FBXMorphPreprocess first).

We recommend exporting the character as FBX. The procedure is as follows:

   1. Go to File -> Export, define the file name, and click Save.
   
   2. Under Export Options, make sure Figures, Animations and Morphs are 
   checked.

   3. Under Output Options, deselect Embed Textures and select Collect Textures
   to Folder. Also enable Merge Clothing into Figure Skeleton.

   4. Next you must Edit Morph Export Rules to define which morph targets will
   be exported and which will ignored or baked into the model. If you want to 
   have the ability to animate a morph target in Max or LEAP (e.g. visemes), 
   you will need to export it. Export rules use string matching to identify
   morph targets by name and apply actions to them. Therefore, for each rule
   you should specify partial or full morph target name, and select appropriate
   action (Export, Bake or Ignore). Rules stack - every rule applies to the
   result of the rules under it. Once you are done, click Accept.

   5. Click Accept and DAZ will export the character.

3.4 Importing the character into 3ds Max

The character can be imported into Max using the Autodesk FBX plug-in. Use
the same settings as specified in section 1.1, except units should be set to
scene units (usually inches) rather than meters.
