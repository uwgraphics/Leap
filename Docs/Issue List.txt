Leap Animation Editor:

#26 [X] In EyeGazeInstance._AdjustGazeParamsForMovingBase, even when look-ahead time is zero, recomputed gaze parameters are different:
  - In WindowWashing test case there are a ton of examples of gaze shifts where Head.maxVelocity is wildly different from original when lookAheadTime = 0
  - Solution will be to modify the gaze controller such that we can specify predicted position offset of the (relatively) moving target and the gaze controller will do the actual computation of gaze shift parameters

#25 [] Sometimes the whole characters snaps to wrong pose and gets rendered
  - Seems to happen when switching between gaze instances, but unsure
  - Affects the whole pose, even the feet - maybe resets to initial pose w/o even applying the body motion!
  - Blatant example in WindowWashing around frame 90
  - The problem is absent in baked clip
  - Seems to happen less frequently after commenting out SceneView.RepaintAll() call in LeapAnimationEditor.Update()
  - Completely baffling, it's like the scene gets repainted before animation is applied, but that should be impossible
  - Removing _AdjustGazeParamsForMovingBase() seems to eliminate the problem
  - Solution to #26 may also fix this issue, keep an eye on it

#24 [] Inference of head and torso alignment values seems to be incorrect in EyeGazeEditor

#23 [X] There is a small discontinuity in gaze joint rotations when a new gaze shift starts after a gap

#22 [X] In WindowWashing example, the very first gaze shift starts in the wrong state, like VOR isn't correctly initialized
  - Mistakenly took out setting fixGaze = true in AnimationTimeline._InitControllers(), fixed now

#21 [X] In EyeGazeEditor.AddEyeGaze(), trimming a gaze-back instance sometimes gives an instance that is shorter than the threshold (minEyeGazeLength)
  - Example - TestGaze7-Back (in InitialPose test case) ends up being 205-209
  - No bug, just threshold set too low

#19 [X] Discontinuities of head and torso rotations at the start of gaze shifts
  - Likely due to VOR state variables not being correctly initialized, yet VOR is getting applied while head and torso are latent
  - This should be taken care of as we implement "boundary cases" - gaze controller kicking in and blending out
  - Should have been taken care of with the changes to VOR when FixGazeTarget is null, yet the problem persists
  - Problem fixed

#20 [] Incongruent eye movements occasionally still happen
  - In InitialPose test case, somewhere between frames 200-300, eye gaze directions become divergent over the course of the gaze shift, though they seem to correct themselves by the end

#18 [X] Head and torso get rotated with full alignment during gaze shifts even when alignment parameter is <1
  - Verified with Head.align and Torso.align both set to 0.5
  - The first gaze shift seems to be correct, but every subsequent one fully aligns the torso, no matter what the alignment value (also tried with Torso.align = 0)
  - All gaze controller state values correctly initialized at the start of the gaze shift
  - Mysteriously, in that first (correct) gaze shift, Torso.distRotAlign keeps decreasing over the course of the gaze instance, even when there is just one torso joint that's latent (not moving)
  - Fixed - the way VOR was implemented was incompatible with the way target pose was initialized at the start of the gaze shift
  
#17 [] Torso joints sometimes snap to wrong rotation values during gaze shifts
  - Continued from #16
  - Some snapping does happen over the span of a single frame - this seems to happen when a new gaze instance gets activated while there is an ongoing gaze shift from the previous instance
  - There is always an active eye gaze instance on the timeline getting applied, so that's not the problem
  - The problem is greatly reduced when we take out base.FinishBake() call from EyeGazeInstance.FinishBake() - could it be a timing issue, with writing out the clip being too slow?
  - Problem reduced by delaying the saving of baked curves until after the whole animation has been played & applied - still happens occasionally, though (check that it's only during playback and not in baked animation)
  - It seems to happen more in WindowWashing test case
  - Seems to happen when switching between gaze instances - or more specifically when transition from NoGaze to  Shifting in the gaze controller
  - The problem seems unrelated to latency
  - Occasionally it doesn't happen at all
  
#16 [X] Torso joints sometimes snap to wrong rotation values during gaze shifts
  - They always seem to snap back to correct rotations, though
  - Also present in baked animation
  - May be related to #12
  - May be happening at gaze instance boundaries, while the gaze shift from the previous instance is still ongoing
  - The problem is greatly reduced when the call to _AdjustGazeParamsForMovingBase() is removed from EyeGazeInstance.Apply()
  - There seem two separate issues here - see #17 for the other one
  - Fixed, the problem was that even inactive eye gaze instances would subscribe to events from the gaze controller, so their initial state would be wrong and _AdjustGazeParamsForMovingBase() would get called even while the gaze shift for the previous target is ongoing

#15 [] Head joint rotations seem to snap/jitter between frames
  - Should check to make sure this artifact is present in baked animation - otherwise the issue is that animation gets rendered before it's applied
  - Doesn't seem to be present in baked animation

#14 [X] Discontinuity in torso joint rotations when starting gaze shift to new target
  - Discontinuity seems to be just in the rotation that gets applied to the model - gaze model values appear to be correct and after a few frames the applied rotation also looks correct
  - Might be related to #15
  - Also present in baked animation
  - Fixed, torso rotation (VOR) was incorrectly applied during latency period

#13 [X] When using more than one Head joint, eyes often fail to reach the gaze target
  - This is like bug #6 again, but now with multiple Head joints
  - Happens in the same place as #6 - WindowWashingGaze3, WindowCenterLeft doesn't get reached
  - Fixed by changing how target rotations for joints are updated to account for body movement - now we just do GazeJoint.UpdateTargerRotation() for the *current* joint, rather than all the subsequent joints; keep this change in mind in case it breaks something else

#12 [] Eyes still sometimes snap during gaze shifts
  - Seems to be happening at gaze shift boundaries
  - Happens often around WindowWashingGaze8 instance, about 210 frames into the WindowWashing animation
  - Can't repro anymore, maybe it's fixed?

#11 [] Gaze controller sometimes enters a broken state where eyes are snapping betwen targets rather than moving smoothly
  - Happens in the final third of InitialPose test case

#10 [X] One or both eyes get stuck before reaching the target
  - Similar to what was going on in #5
  - See TestGaze5 with InitialPose as base animation, for example
  - Improved OMR clamping, bug seems to be fixed for now

#9 [X] One or more of the eyes snap back after reaching gaze target, when they should VOR
  - Can't repro, but keep an eye on it
  - This seems to be caused by ClampMRToSource(), which snaps the rotations right back to source, because CheckMR() indicates we are starting outside OMR even at source rotations!
  - Provisional fix added to ClampMRToSource(), but it won't be very robust

#8 [] Saccadic velocities are too low - they should be in excess of 500 deg/s for pure saccades, but they barely reach 200 deg/s

#7 [X] One of the eyes snaps back after reaching the gaze target sometimes
  - This happens when applying WindowWashing gaze sequence to static pose (InitialPose)
  - The problem is due to OMR clamping in GazeJoint.ApplyVOR()

#6 [X] Due to opposing body movement, some gaze shifts are unable to reach their target
  - This can cause gaze snapping when another gaze shift is triggered
  - See for example WindowWashingGaze3, where WindowCenterLeft is never reached
  - Fundamentally this is because we fail to consider the future when synthesizing a gaze shift - i.e., how far the eyes and head will actually have to rotate due to unexpected changes in body movement direction, which determines also max. velocities of the gaze joints
  - Taking into account the future pose gives us somewhat higher max. velocities, but insufficient to compensate for opposing movement of the body
  - Removing rot. progress normalization greatly improves the appearance of gaze shifts, since eyes are now always progressing forward - but is this neurophysiologically correct?
  - One problem is, HEAD doesn't move at all - that's because headAlign = 0 and target is within OMR; however, without head contribution the eyes seem to be too slow
  - This is pure saccadic gaze, yet peak eye velocity is far too low (~180 deg/s) - it should be closer to 500 deg/s!
  - Testing the same gaze sequence with static pose (InitialPose) and the eyes get "stuck" in the same spot w/o ever reaching the gaze target - must be a bug
  - It was a bug - fixed now, there was an UpdateTargetRotations() call in the wrong place

#5 [X] Target rotations don't get correctly computed in VOR, causing a discontinuity of head rotations when VOR kicks in
  - Maybe fixTarget should be the same for *all* joints, rather than different for each
  - It is now and this seems to have gotten rid of some discontinuities

#3 [X] Target rotations of the root joint in the gaze joint chain don't get updated correctly to compensate for body motion
  - Fixed now, not entirely sure if it works properly

#2 [X] When playing back the timeline and layering TestLookLeft, the animation TestLookLeft is applied at the final pose instantly after 0th frame ("final pose" being the pose of the last keyframe), rather than smoothly interpolated
  - This happens in both additive and override layering modes
  - Timing of the animation instance is correct
  - Animation interpolates correctly when clip is played in Unity Animation window.
  - Might be the same bug as above - when layering a synthesized gaze animation (Gaze1), gaze shift is extremely quick (~3 frames or ~100 ms)
  - Playing the animation clip in Unity Animation window works as expected - gaze shift is ~20 frames
  - Fixed by making sure clip time is correctly set for in both AnimationClipInstance.Apply() and AnimationControllerInstance.Apply()

#1 [X] Animation baking using AnimationTimeline.BakeRange() gives a completely messed up animation


Character Models:

#4 [] Norman model gets a bit cross-eyed when animating gaze using standard gaze model - cross-eyedness removal might be necessary
