LeapAnimationEditor:

[] When playing back the timeline and layering TestLookLeft, the animation TestLookLeft is applied at the final pose instantly after 0th frame ("final pose" being the pose of the last keyframe), rather than smoothly interpolated.
    - This happens in both additive and override layering modes.
    - Timing of the animation instance is correct.
    - Animation interpolates correctly when clip is played in Unity Animation window.
    
[] (Might be the same bug as above) When layering a synthesized gaze animation (Gaze1), gaze shift is extremely quick (~3 frames or ~100 ms)
    - Playing the animation clip in Unity Animation window works as expected - gaze shift is ~20 frames

[X] Animation baking using AnimationTimeline.BakeRange() gives a completely messed up animation


Models:

[] Norman model gets a bit cross-eyed when animating gaze using standard gaze model - cross-eyedness removal might be necessary
