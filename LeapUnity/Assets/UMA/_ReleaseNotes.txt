UMA version 1.1.x.x - Unity version 4.3.1 or higher required. UMA requirement will stay at 4.3.1 until there is a compelling reason to upgrade.

Release notes are no longer being maintained. If you want the full history look at the git log. 
Version numbers signify breaking changes 1.1.0.0 will contains warnings of breaking changes introduced in 1.2.0.0. 
So if you ever fall multiple version behind updating to each minor version and then removing all warnings is a safe way to get back to speed.















Changes
1.0.1.0R - UMAMaterialBuilder received changes and has been simplified.
1.0.1.0RC2 - Included an Example folder, moved assets and scripts specific to example scene to this folder.
1.0.1.0RC2 - UpdateCollider() is now set at UMACrowd, umaData.OnUpdated += myColliderUpdateMethod;
1.0.1.0RC2 - moved RuntimeAnimatorController animationController from UMAGenerator to UMAData.
1.0.0.7b - Included an per slot overlayScale adjust, it works together with atlasResolutionScale value.
1.0.0.7b - Now there´s an optional choice to automatically reduce overlays if they don´t fit atlas.
1.0.0.7b - Changed atlas algorithm from RectBottomLeftRule to RectBestShortSideFit, as it gives better results in junction with automatic atlas crop.
1.0.0.7b - AtlasCrop is now optional
1.0.0.7b - Ponytail FemaleHair2 Module
1.0.0.7b - Serialization standard now uses LitJson.
1.0.0.7b - Extra adjusts: Gluteus, headShape, eye size/rotation and extra optional breast adjust control.
1.0.0.7b - All prefab Assets (overlays, Slots and Races) were converted to Scriptable Objects.
1.0.0.7b - Shape changes are now integrated with Mecanim avatar creation API. Unity 4.3 will make it possible changing shape without reseting animation.
1.0.0.7b - Base meshes received UV layout changes.
1.0.0.7b - Included elven ears and pig nose for male base mesh, as an example of 
combining head parts (We now have the mighty Elven PigMan on demo scene! Yay).
1.0.0.7b - From now on, UMAMaterialBuilder normal map textures should NOT be set as normal maps before being converted for UMA standard.
1.0.0.6b - new Male and female content.
1.0.0.6b - UMADnaHumanoid changes:armSize is now armLength, inclusion of forearmLength, forearmLength and forearmWidth, those areas dont receive influence from upperMuscle and upperWeight.
1.0.0.6b - small adjusts on DNAConverters, both to handle extra sliders and improve uppermuscle influence over spine1.
1.0.0.6b - Included Load/Save example to UMACustomizer
1.0.0.6b - separated PackRecipe/UnpackRecipe and formatter
1.0.0.6b - Joen adjusted UMA material builder to handle fbx files from different coordinate systems.
1.0.0.5b - Adjusts on atlas generation for PRO, offset adjust on final texture for resolution variation.
1.0.0.5b - By default, all textures are full resolution, and atlasresolutionScale is 0.5f.
1.0.0.5b - new Male content included.
1.0.0.5b - Optimized female overlay textures, this brings a faster atlas calculation on indie.
1.0.0.4b - Slots don´t have predefined overlays. This adjust was necessary for serialization.
1.0.0.4b - Slots creation on UMACrowd received adjusts.
1.0.0.4b - using Unity version 4.2 (Mecanim API on following versions).
1.0.0.4b - FemaleEyebrow01 overlay uses Rect for reducing texture size.
1.0.0.2b - Renamed UMAData.slotData to UMAData.SlotData

New features
1.0.1.0R - optional Legacy CombineInstances included on UMACrowd exampleCode. 
1.0.0.7b - Script to handle forearm twist bone.
1.0.0.7b - OverlayLibrary now provides extra functionality to handle mass overlay changes.
1.0.0.7b - Helper to Save/Load avatars.
1.0.0.3b - SlotList array can have empty elements. 
1.0.0.1b - Slots rig can be different from base rig. Extra bones are included on final mesh.
1.0.0.1b - UMA´s have their own converters for handling Dna data (HumanFemaleDNAConverterBehaviour, HumanMaleDNAConverterBehaviour), it´s now possible to include converters to handle slots with extra bones.
1.0.0.1b - Uma Material Builder handle Seam removal on Slot creation.

Fixed
1.0.1.0RC2 - Removed calling System.IO.File.ReadAllText(path) and LoadFromMemoryStream() twice on Save/Load.
1.0.1.0RC2 - Female Eyelashes was using an old rig data, and has been updated.
1.0.0.7b - UMAMaterialBuilder SeamRemoval recalculates tangents after copying normals from base unified mesh, better handling junction area.
1.0.0.7b - All UMA example shaders had been adjusted to unpack normals following same standard, this corrects normal maps showing incorreclty on 
Mobile devices.
1.0.0.7b - Corrected a bug on overlay positioning based on Rect, in case values were fractions and not using PRO.
1.0.0.4b - Memoryleak on RenderTextures.
1.0.0.4b - UMA serialization won´t pack channelMask and channelAdditiveMask in this version;
1.0.0.4b - Small value changes on atlas textures;
1.0.0.1b - Mixing slots that uses different shaders is not available on this version.
1.0.0.1b - Generating avatars requite atlas creation, without creating atlas, we have an material ordering issue.
1.0.0.1b - As consequence of including extra bones, UMA creation requires extra processing. This step will receive further optimization.
1.0.0.1b - Importing project files from pack leads to reloading assets and losing seams removal step. This will be handled creating a new resulting skinnedMesh instead of referencing to existing one.(Working on duplicated skinnedMesh)
1.0.0.0b - Atlas is not optimized and might not bring most efficient solution.
1.0.0.0b - White border on female hair 02 without using atlas sharing will be handled with a proper alpha channel. (Unity 4.2 Alpha is transparency)
1.0.0.0b - overlay rect generates different behavion on Indie and PRO. Until then, overlays might need to keep the same size as base textures.
1.0.0.0b - Mixing slots that uses different shaders mess with UV calculation. Until correcting this, it´s recommended to add all slots sharing the same shader in sequence.
1.0.0.0b - UMA serialization will be rewritten considering the adjusts included and new features. Any multiplayer/mmo dev planning sharing data between client and server, please keep an eye on umaPack() that will be included.
1.0.0.0b - UMA still only works when the game is running and resulting UMA still can´t saved. This will be handled together with serialization.

Known bugs / limitations 
1.0.1.0 R - On windows builds and for some specific hardware configuration, Unity crashes on application quit. Unity team is 
already working to fix this bug, following Unity versions might handle that.
1.0.1.0 RC1 - LogError "PPtr cast failed when dereferencing! Casting from DefaultAsset to Camera!" Still did not managed to find exactly how to reproduce 
this error, but it is reported while under avatar Atlas creation, specifically for PRO users using RenderTexture. As even getting the error
atlas creation and all steps of avatar creation proceed with no negative consequence, its been a challenge to identify what is triggering it.
1.0.1.0 RC1 - SkinnedMeshCombiner won´t correctly merge Slots with extra bones that provides no influence to any mesh vertice.
1.0.1.0 RC1 - While working on mobile devices, keep in mind some types of compressions forces square textures, breaking overlay rect settings. As theres still no way to 
access original texture size, at least for now its recommended using uncompressed lower resolution setting for overlays.
1.0.0.0b - Linear Rendering (Unity Pro) is not supported and most likely requires adjustments for the entire project.
